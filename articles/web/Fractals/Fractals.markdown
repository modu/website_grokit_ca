# Fractals 

I wrote a small Javascript runner in the browser where you can play with the formula. You can save your fractal as a URL and share with friends. Of course, I provided a Mandelbrot set as the default fractal.

As always, this is all open-source including the code for this page. See the [source on github](https://github.com/grokit/website_grokit_ca/tree/master/ws_root/ws_django/spc/fractal_canvas) and feel free to fork and have fun with it.

Happy fracting!
