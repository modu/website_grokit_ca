â†¦: |-> means 'map to'.

## Notes

- Distinction between what it is, and the underlying implementation.
- Vector: same as a list, but usually contiguous in memory.
- {} is unordered set, () order matters and no repetition

	- Capital letters usually represent sets, or collections of objects. E.g:

	P = [p1, p2, p3]
	or
	P = {p1, p2, p3}
