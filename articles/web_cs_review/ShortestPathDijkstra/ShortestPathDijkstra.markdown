# Shortest Path Dijkstra's Algorithm

Given an undirected graph with edge weights, find the shortest path between two nodes.

# Graph Dataset

dext.insertCode("undirected_weighted_graph_simple.dot")

You can change the graph and play around plotting here: [http://graphs.grevian.org/graph](http://graphs.grevian.org/graph).

# Discussion

If negative edge weights were allowed, what would it mean for our solution?

The [A* algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is fundamentally the same as Dijkstra except that is uses heuristics in the order in which it visits the graph's nodes.
