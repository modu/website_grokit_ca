Most of this was all originally generated from a python script that scraped C++ problems that I had solved. Don't regenerate the entries from the code (stored elsewhere), I have edited some files manually.

**When I change the code, I add it in the folder of the .markdown file.**

I now add new material staring here. DRY: this is where the authoritative files live.
