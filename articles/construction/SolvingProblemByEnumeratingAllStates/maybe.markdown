### When There Are Less Slots Than Objects

What if you have 4 fruits, but only 3 meals to eat fruit in? Then the 'n!' equation is not valid.

### Example: Sorting

Every number has only one place in the sorted array (assuming a [stable sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_sort#Stability)).

## ((Base Case)++)++: Binomial Coefficient

$$\tfrac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}$$

# Appendix: Party Problem

You invite N people to a party. How many different combinations of people can show up?

(Don't care about order).

2^N

--> everyone can be in either "there" or "not there" state.

What does the problem become if we care about order? (how many combinations of people arriving can there be?)
