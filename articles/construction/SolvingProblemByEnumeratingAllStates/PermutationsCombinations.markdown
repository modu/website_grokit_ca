Set A: [a, b, c, d] of length n. How many different ways to combine those objects?

# Permutations

Allows repetitions

O(n^^n)

## What if Have Less Choices than Objects?

n choose k?
^^ this would eliminate repetitions.

# Combinations

Unique sets -- every letter can be there or not.

O(2^^n)

...or n!?

^^ what if you restrict the number of letters?
