# Tagging System

tag::organization system

bucket::read list

Should have a master file that describe all valid tags and rules about them.
If tags that have no master definition, raise a warning.

How to do function?

function::insertFile(filename) ?

Is that good to have a free for all or should I lock down definition?

~~

How to split organization of things to do.

High level: goals

Mid level: what realization of those goals look like.

Low level: schedule actions / smaller "step-goals" that fit in a month.

Micro level: daily tasks.

^^ is this similar to GTD "5000 foot view"?
