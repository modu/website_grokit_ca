<h1>Krowten Emagyp</h1>
<p>This is a small game that I developed along with 2 other students as a class project, back in my college days. It is a small ('mario-clone') game engine demo with interesting physics and that can be on a network (1..inf players ... in theory!). It is full of bugs and the code is awful (our first concact with the python programming language) but the end result is quite fun. Built with python + <a href="http://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYPYOHOXbJ8">You can see a demo video here</a></p>
<p>The version that is available online is quite boring as it is what we used for the demo; a lot of constraints were put on the engine in order to avoid showcasing our bugs during the presentation. I have been planning for years to spend a few hours to unlock the 'fun' in the game, but never got around to it. Maybe one day!</p>
<p><strong>Important:press 'n' at the beginning of the game in order to spawn your player</strong></p>
