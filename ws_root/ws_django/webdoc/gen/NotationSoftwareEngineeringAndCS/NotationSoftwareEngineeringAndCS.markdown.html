<h1>Notation for Software Engineering and CS</h1>
<p>CS and Math have a rich and well defined syntax to express the difference between different primitives (e.g: literal, set, list, ...). However, since ideas and documentation often needs to be done in plain-text, there is no official</p>
<p>This article attempts to achieve the following goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>All-in one place definition and explanation of the notation for common computer science primitives.</li>
<li>For all the primitives in 1., suggest a consistent annotation for plain-text files.</li>
<li>A reference place for myself so that I am consistent with my notation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Elementary Types</h2>
<h3>Literal</h3>
<p>Literals are simple values. For example, in <code>int i = 1</code>, i is a literal. Literals start with a lowercase letter. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>    int i = 1;
    float pressure = 0.5;
    string name = "Marcus Aurelius";
</code></pre>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>An array is a collection of elements. Those elements can be literals, or complex objects.</p>
<p>Arrays uses square brackets: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2].</p>
<p>They are a collection of element with no special restrictions (can repeat, no specific order). Arrays are usually contiguous in memory.</p>
<p>Note that many languages (such as C++) use curly brackets as array initializers -- that conflicts with that is typically used in Mathematics: curly banquets '{' and '}' are usually reserved for <em>sets</em>.</p>
<h3>Tuple</h3>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of elements <em>where the order matters</em>. A n-tuple is a sequence of n elements. For example, (1, 2, 3) is a 3-tuple.</p>
<p>Since the <em>order matters</em>, (1, 2, 3) and (3, 2, 1) are two distinct tuples.</p>
<p>Value can repeat in tuples and are not necessarily ordered. So (5, 5, 5, 1, 4) is a valid tuple. (5, 5) is a distinct tuple from (5).</p>
<p>Square brackets '[]' are also sometime used as a notation for tuple since tuples are very similar to arrays.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Set</h3>
<p>A set is a collection of distinct objects. Think of a set as telling you if an element is present or not.</p>
<p>For example, the set of people at a party can either contain or not contain each of your friend once.</p>
<p>Set use curly brackets; {1, 2, 3} is a set of items 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Since order does not matter in sets, {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1}; they are considered equivalent. However, it is less confusing to order the elements in a set as a matter of convention, so {1, 2, 3} would be preferred to {3, 2, 1} or {2, 3, 1}, although all three sets are equivalent.</p>
<p>Note that {1, 2, 2} is not a valid set since set do not repeat elements; 2 is present or not, having it twice in the set is meaningless.</p>
<h4>Set Relationship</h4>
<p>A ⊆ B indicates that A is a <em>subset</em> of B.</p>
<p>A ⊆ B holds true for: A = {1, 2}, B = {1, 2, 3} since all element of A are also in B.</p>

<h2>Complex Types</h2>
<h3>Graphs</h3>
<p>Graphs are a set of vertices (singular: vertex, somtimes also called nodes) where some pair of vertices are connected by edges (sometimes called links).</p>
<p>A popular notation for graphs is <code>G = (V, E)</code>, where V is a set of vertices which are connected by edges E, which are 2-element subsets of V.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>    V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    E = {{1, 2}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {4, 6}}
</code></pre>
<p>... is a valid graph.</p>
<p>Since E is a set of set, it implies that the edges are not directed and that there are no self loops. In order to have either of those, E would need to be a set of tuples; e.g.: E = {(1,2), (2,1), (2,2), ...}. Here (2, 1) implies a directed edge from vertex 2 to 1.</p>
<p>For a complete yet accessible review of graphs and their use in CS, see [MIT6_042, section 5.1.1] (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_notes.pdf).</p>
<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>A matrix is a rectangular 2D-array of elements arranges in <em>rows</em> and <em>columns</em>.</p>
<p>A column is vertical whereas a row is horizontal.</p>
<p>A common convention with matrices is that the first number (y) represents the column, and the second (x) the line. In general, column represent different <em>dimentions</em>: they represent different type of entities whereas the line elements represent another instance of the same type of entity.</p>
<p>Matrixes can be represented in plain-text files using a capital letter followed by an underscore, then the column and row number: M_y,x. For example, the last element of a 3x3 matrix 'M' is denoted as M_3,3.</p>
<p>The complete matrix can be enumerated by using square brackets. Since it is hard to represent matrices in a a text file, the coma (;) represents the end of a line. So [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6] is the same as:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3
 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Transpose is 'T', so [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]T is:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 4
 2, 5
 3, 6]
</code></pre>
