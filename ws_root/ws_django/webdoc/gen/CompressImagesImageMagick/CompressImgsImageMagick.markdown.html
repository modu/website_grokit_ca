<h1>Compress Images Using ImageMagick</h1>
<p>The quality factor of the .jpg format is largerly unknown. This result in a lot of images that are easily four to five time as big as they need to be (for the same 'visible' quality).</p>
<p>The method that I am going to show here is going to reduce the size of every picture in a directory to about 500k. This compression will reduce the quality of the picture, but not enough to make it noticeable to the naked eye.</p>
<p>First of all, go download the excellent ImageMagick software at http://www.imagemagick.org/ (dl: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows">win</a>, <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#unix">linux</a>)</p>
<p>Once the software is installed, go to the directory containing the files (it would be wise to back-up your pictures first) and type in the command line:</p>
<pre><code>mogrify -resize "2048x2048&gt;" -quality 75 *.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>What it will do is that it will take each picture individually, resize it to 2048x[...] pixels and change the quality setting. I chose 75 because it yields the greatest compression/quality loss ratio. Check it out for yourself, I am sure you can't tell the difference between the compressed picture and the original. This typically reduces the size of a 3,000 Kb picture to under 500Kb.</p>
<p>Here are some other cool things you can do with ImageMagick intalled:</p>
<pre><code>Get the picture properties:
  identify -verbose abc.jpg

Compare the diff between two pictures:
  compare -metric MAE First. png Second.jpg diff.png

Burn a logo into a pic:
  (more on composing: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/compose/)
  (Use white background)
  composite -gravity NorthWest -compose color-burn logo.png image.jpg out.jpg

Write text on all pictures:
  (x,y , dx,dy) 0,0 = original size
  mogrify -draw "image color-burn 4,4 0,0 'logo.png'" *.jpg
  convert -draw "image color-burn 4,4 0,0 'logo.png'" *.jpg out.jpg
</code></pre>
