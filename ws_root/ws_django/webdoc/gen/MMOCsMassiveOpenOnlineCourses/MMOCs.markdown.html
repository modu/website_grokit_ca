<h1>Classes Half-Taken</h1>
<h2>University of Washington Networks</h2>
<p>https://class.coursera.org/comnetworks-003</p>
<p>What I did: watched about half the videos. Was a good refresher on network stuff.</p>
<p>Opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class does a good job of not falling into details too much, explains why networks are the way they are (impefect) as a result of history.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parser Class (Programming Languages)</h2>
<p>https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs262</p>
<p>I really liked what I was learning, did not know much about lexers, compilers and parsers and that was fascinating to learn about.</p>
<p>I will probably resume that class at some point in the future.</p>
