<h1>Remove Duplicate Pictures Created by Picasa</h1>
<p>Did you ever notice that (the otherwise excellent) <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> creates a backup of any picture that has been modified? I could never find an option to suppress that behavior. I mean, I know what I am doing; I do not want to have extra copies of my pictures laying around and taking up all my disk space.</p>
<p>So I built a small application that lists the ".picasaoriginals" folders location under the folder where the Python script is run from. It lists the content of the ".picasaoriginals" and prompts the user for deletion.</p>
<h2>Example of the command-prompt interation with the program</h2>
<pre><code>python DelPicasaOriginalBackups.py

Folder:
C:\pics\09-01-03 - Montreal\.picasaoriginals
Content:
{IMG_7432.jpg,IMG_7433.jpg,IMG_7434.jpg}

Do you want to delete the following folder and everything in sub-dirs?
C:\pics\09-01-03 - Montreal\.picasaoriginals
N/Y?
