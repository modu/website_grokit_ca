<h1>Get Full Access Right to A Folder Using Cygwin Under Windows 7</h1>
<p>It can be pretty hard to get full access rights to a directory and all its contents recursively when using cygwin under windows 7. In theory a simple <code>chmod 777 -R "c:\path_to\target\folder</code> should do the trick, but it just isn't so. Here is the most 'bulletproof' way I found to make sure I get proper ownership of a folder:</p>
<pre><code>takeown /F "C:\path_to\target\folder" /R
icacls "C:\path_to\target\folder" /grant Everyone:\(F\) /T
icacls "C:\path_to\target\folder"
chmod 777 -R "c:\path_to\target\folder"
</code></pre>
<p>Or for the current dir:</p>
<pre><code>takeown /F "." /R
icacls "." /grant Everyone:\(F\) /T
icacls "."
chmod 777 -R "."
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icacls">icacls.exe</a> is window's command-line tools to modify the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Control_List">Access Control List</a> and 'takeown.exe' "<code>allows an administrator to recover access to a file that was denied by re-assigning file ownership</code>". I guess doing all three commands subsequently (takeown, icacls and chmod) is the blunt solution that has o be used until the cygwin team gets around to get <code>chmod</code> to work properly on windows 7.</p>
